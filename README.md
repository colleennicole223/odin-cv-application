### Continued development

Would be interested in,

### Useful resources

1. Can create vite in existing folder using, `npm create vite@latest ./` from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/pk92o7/use_vite_in_the_current_directory/)
2. ChatGPT for smaller notation such using `.filter` or how to approach `handleInputChange` functions
